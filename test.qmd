Our project explores the relationships between foreign-born population, educational attainment, and voting rates for Trump. We applied techniques such as cross-validation and K-means clustering. The following images show some of the visualizations:


```{r}
ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = foreignborn_pct, y = trump16_pct)) +
geom_point() +
geom_smooth(method = "lm")

set.seed(244)
kmeans_6_round_1 <- kmeans(scale(numeric_data), centers = 6)
numeric_data %>%
mutate(kmeans_cluster = as.factor(kmeans_6_round_1$cluster)) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = lesscollege_pct, y = trump16_pct, color = kmeans_cluster)) +
geom_point(size = 3) +
theme(legend.position = "none") +
labs(title = "K-means with K = 6 (round 1)") +
theme_minimal()
```
